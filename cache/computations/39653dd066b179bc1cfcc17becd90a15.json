      "text": "Fill in PDF Forms Is the form fillable? Not all forms are fillable. Sometimes form creators don\u2019t convert their PDFs to interactive fillable forms. Or, they intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the Fill & Sign tool. These non-interactive forms are called flat forms. Fill in interactive forms An interactive form contains fields that you can select or fill in. 1. If necessary, select either the Hand Tool or the Select Tool from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the Hand tool changes to an I -beam when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages.",

It could be a paper form or PDF that hasn\u2019t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if required. You can complete the forms by entering information and adding your signatures. Acrobat also allows you to send your completed forms to others and securely save them in Adobe cloud storage. Fill and sign PDF forms To complete and sign PDF forms, open the form in Acrobat and then select E-Sign from the global bar. Alternatively, you can select All tools > Fill & Sign . It displays the Fill & Sign tools in the left pane. You can now fill in the form fields and sign the form using the sign tools described in the following topics. To fill text fields: 1. From the left panel, select Fill in form fields , and then select the field where you want to add text. It displays a text field along with a toolbar. 2. Select the text field again and enter your text. 3. To reposition the text box to align it with the text field, select the textbox and hover over it. Once you see a plus icon with arrows, move the textbox to the desired position. 4. To edit the text, select the text box. Once you see the cursor and keypad, edit the text and then click elsewhere to enter. 5. To change the text size, select A or A as required.",

When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you\u2019re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn\u2019t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register th e digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certif icates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of truste d identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide . Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it.",
