Type your user name and password, or follow the directions to create an account. Select Next , and then select Finish. Once the roaming ID is added, it can be used for signing or encryption. When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you\u2019re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn\u2019t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register th e digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certif icates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of truste d identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide . Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it.",
