      "text": "What \u2019s the best way to create a PDF? You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign\u00ae files, digital images, and more. Different types of sources have different tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don \u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and th e quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to thos e settings. If you want more control over the process, you \u2019ll want to use another method. PDF creation methods by file type Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the different types of files. File Type PDF Creation Methods Any file format Method 1 : From the top tools bar, select Create . Then, select a file type and then select the file that you want to convert to PDF. Or, select the hamburger menu (Windows) or the File menu (macOS) > Create and then select the appropriate file type and follow through the steps. Method 2 : Drag and drop a file from your system to the Acrobat Home page. Method 3: Right -click on the file and then select Convert to Adobe PDF .",
